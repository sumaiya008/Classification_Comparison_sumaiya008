# Classification Models Comparison
The goal of this notebook is to explore and compare the decision boundaries of different classifiers using Synthetic Datasets, which provides insight into when certain classification models perform better than others.

The models explored in this notebook are:
- Naive Bayes
-  Logistic Regression
-  Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
-  Support Vector Machine using RBF Kernel
-  Decision Tree
-  K-Nearest Neighbors.
